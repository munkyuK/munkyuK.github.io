I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley jointly working with [Rikky Muller](https://www.rikkymuller.com) and [Laura Waller](https://www.laurawaller.com). I am interested in optical microscopes and imaging systems, holographic imaging, bioimaging, design of optical imaging setups and developing computational imaging algorithm. I work on setting up computer generated holography (CGH) system and optimizing algorithm with brand new MEMS-based fast spatial light modulator (SLM).

Before coming to UC Berkeley, I worked 10 months as a postdoc at Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics (CMSD), Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in South Korea, where I helped develop model-based optimization algorithm that retrieves an object function in a multi-core fiber holographic endoscope. Previously, I obtained PhD degree at Korea University in [Wonshik Choi](https://www.bioimaging.korea.ac.kr/)'s lab. My past research was developing flexible lensless fiber bundle endoscope system for label-free high-resolution biological imaging.
