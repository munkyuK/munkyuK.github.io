Abstract : Holographic endoscopes have garnered extensive attention not only for their compactness but also for their high-resolution and wide-field imaging capabilities. However, their practical use is challenging due to the reliance on Fesnel approximations in the underlying image reconstruction protocol, limiting their real-world applications. In this study, we present a model-based optimization algorithm that successfully retrieves an object function in a fiber bundle holographic endoscope. By developing a mathematical model that eliminates the need for approximations, our optimization extends the working range and expands the field of view of a fiber bundle holographic endoscope while preserving its advantages. These advancements significantly enhance the utility and feasibility of holographic endoscopes for various diagnostic procedures.
