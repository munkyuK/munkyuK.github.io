Abstract: Conventional fiber-bundle-based endoscopes allow minimally invasive imaging through flexible multi-core fiber (MCF) bundles by placing a miniature lens at the distal tip and using each core as an imaging pixel. In recent years, lensless imaging through MCFs was made possible by correcting the core-to-core phase distortions pre-measured in a calibration procedure. However, temporally varying wavefront distortions, for instance, due to dynamic fiber bending, pose a challenge for such approaches. Here, we demonstrate a coherent lensless imaging technique based on intensity-only measurements insensitive to core-to-core phase distortions. We leverage a ptychographic reconstruction algorithm to retrieve the phase and amplitude profiles of reflective objects placed at a distance from the fiber tip, using as input a set of diffracted intensity patterns reflected from the object when the illumination is scanned over the MCF cores. Our approach thus utilizes an acquisition process equivalent to confocal microendoscopy, only replacing the single detector with a camera.
