Abstract: We present an electrostatically-actuated, piston-motion micromirror array for applications in 3D point scanning and holography. Individual mirror pixels can be controlled with low-voltage analog drive over a 300 nm actuation range and achieve 10–90% mechanical settling times of less than 160 μs. An efficient pixel tiling scheme that allows adjacent mirrors to share the anchors of the suspension structure results in a 94% fill factor for high optical efficiency.
